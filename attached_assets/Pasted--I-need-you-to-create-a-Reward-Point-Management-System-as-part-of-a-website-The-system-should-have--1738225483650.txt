"I need you to create a Reward Point Management System as part of a website. The system should have the following features:

Admin Dashboard:

A secure admin login to manage the entire system.

Ability to view all customers and their reward point balances.

Option to add, deduct, or update reward points for individual customers.

A log or history of all point transactions (e.g., points earned, redeemed, or adjusted).

Ability to create and manage reward items or gift options that customers can redeem their points for.

Customer Login:

A separate customer login portal where customers can:

View their current reward point balance.

See their transaction history (points earned and redeemed).

Browse available rewards or gift options.

Redeem their points for rewards (with a confirmation process).

Reward Point System:

Customers earn points based on predefined rules (e.g., purchases, referrals, etc.).

Points can be redeemed for rewards, and the system should automatically deduct the points when a reward is claimed.

Notifications or alerts for customers when they earn or redeem points.

Design and User Experience:

Clean and intuitive design for both the admin dashboard and customer portal.

Mobile-friendly and responsive layout.

Clear instructions for customers on how to earn and redeem points.

Security:

Secure login for both admin and customers (e.g., password protection, optional two-factor authentication).

Data encryption for sensitive information like customer details and point balances.

Additional Features (Optional):

Email or SMS notifications for customers about their point balance and reward updates.

Integration with an e-commerce platform (if applicable) to automatically award points for purchases.

Analytics for the admin to track reward point usage and customer engagement.

Please ensure the system is easy to use, scalable, and well-documented for future updates. Let me know if you need any additional details to proceed."
